CHALLENGE PROJECT
=================

This is a submission for the challenge project.  It presents a store that sells three really great foods.

It is built on Play with Cassandra persistence.

Play will serve pages to 127.0.0.1:9000 when the app is running.

Cassandra will create a table in the "challenge" keyspace that can be populated by browsing to /init.
Cassandra is controlled via the Phantom DSL for simplicity.

To start the app use `activator run`

To start tests use `activator test`

Enjoy!
